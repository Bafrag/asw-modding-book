# Moveset

<hr>

Movesets are defined on a per-character basis in a custom scripting engine developed by Arcsys. These scripts are called BBS.

Although the core battle state manager of Arcsys games is still somewhat of a mystery to us, BBS has since been blown wide open, allowing us to not just alter characters, but create entirely new ones as well.

We highly recommend you read [A Sketch of the Arc System Works Engine Script](https://web.archive.org/web/20221115035259/https://pangaea.neocities.org/post/sketch-of-arcsys-scripting/), by pangaea, first.

For the sake of consistency, all example code uses internal Arcsys nomenclature. Game-specific code might be included where deemed necessary.
