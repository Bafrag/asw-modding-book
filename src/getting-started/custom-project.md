# Getting the project for your game

As stated in the previous page, the prebuilt custom projects will make modding much easier. They provide all of the custom asset types the game supports, and for newer games, they even include many assets from the game, such as UI elements or data tables. 

Below are download links for each game:

- [Dragon Ball FighterZ custom project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-wjbe0aE4Xs8S7AunSB0XtAE-sSZsOnW/view?usp=sharing)
- The original Granblue Fantasy Versus does not have a custom project.
- [Guilty Gear -Strive- custom project](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApT7KvOr_B0hgcnnF_wKrCaxCVbm8yg?e=SAufMR)
- [DNF Duel custom project](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApT7KvOr_B0hgY3rUBgqs787KHi5_iY?e=xKuxrI)
- [Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising custom project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA1WYxkxpOUpNqSi5kANLUhh4Ja7A_4l/view?usp=drive_link)

Once you have downloaded the correct project, you will need to compile the project for your engine. This will require installing Visual Studio. 

- Dragon Ball FighterZ requires Visual Studio 2017.
- Guilty Gear -Strive-, DNF Duel, and Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising require Visual Studio 2019.
